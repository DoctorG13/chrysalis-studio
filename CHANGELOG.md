# Changelog

All notable changes to Chrysalis are recorded here.

## Database Foundation

### Added

- Added a persistent SQLite database foundation for local business data.
- Added schema version tracking and migration checksums.
- Added automatic pre-migration database backups.
- Added database inspection and backup CLI commands.
- Added a local API health endpoint for database status.
- Added a minimum Node.js requirement of 24.15.0 for the built-in SQLite runtime.
- Protected the `data/` directory from Git so client databases and backups are never committed.
- Added a safe legacy `chrysalis-clients` JSON importer.
- Added deterministic IDs so a repeated import does not create duplicate records.
- Added a pre-import SQLite backup.
- Preserved the complete original client/job records in `data_json` fields during import.

### Architecture

- Established the application/database separation required for future client updates.
- Database migrations are additive and versioned; an already-applied migration cannot be silently changed.
- Existing client data will remain in the persistent database while application revisions are deployed independently.
- Legacy localStorage data remains untouched during the import phase.

- Added database backup, settings export, and settings reset actions.
- Added a compact settings navigation and consistent action buttons.
- Reduced redundant Settings headings and simplified the Workspace & Data wording.
- Hid the sidebar scrollbar while preserving scrolling.
